Notes on Interview Task:

These are just step by step notes so you can follow how I completed the task - mainly so you have a bit of a better
idea of how I work, thought this might be helpful.

App is called Hospital

# - generate an object model (using standard UML notation)
# - generate a database diagram (using standard UML notation)

==> I don't always do the diagrams - really depends on the type of project. I felt it would help here since we don't have an interface.

# - using RVM - created a gemset (using ruby 2.2.2)
# - generated a new app
# - configured the gems needed
# - bundle install
# - added my standard .gitignore
# - initialized the git repo
# - removed the standard config/database.yml  (my gitignore ensures this is not copied to the repo)
# - added a shared folder - which is added to the .gitignore
# - added a database.yml file to the shared directory
# - created the DEV and TEST databases
# - run rails migrations for the tables referenced in the data model.
# - I usually stard the TDD process once the migrations are run - i.e. at this point the models do not yet exist!
	(I don't have any preference on this - just feels better this way as the tests are created first)
# - I added the UUID extension to this - since I am using postgres on my current DEV machine - and like this feature
    (out of habit) - for the purpose of this small app - not required - I just did it because I could.. :)
# - DEV and TEST db's migrated
# - Configured the app for using RSPEC and added a range of helpers to run tests without the RAILS framework!
# - added a rake task for testing and guard to run all the tests automatically
# - now I can run bundle exec guard - to have all the tests run with every change - tight feedback loop!
# - Added the patient and child patients spec files and then the actual models
# - Added the ward and child wards spec files and then the actual models
# -
